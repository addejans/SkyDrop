# SkyDrop

SkyDrop is a **revolutionary** new approach and product that tests the quality of a body of water using a drone. 
The user selects the destinations desired for water testing using the **Google Maps API**, and SkyDrop automatically optimizes the path that the drone will travel. 
SkyDrop then sends the flight path to the drone. 
The quadcopter flies over each destination and dips its testing stick into the water to gather statistical data related to the quality of the water at that destination. 
Lastly, the statistical data is reported back to the user, and is uploaded on a database for public use and verification.
